                <h1>Project V60-T: Fusing Scandinavian Steel with Silicon Valley Soul</h1>

                <p>
                    Welcome to the home of my long-term passion project. For years, I've had this idea brewing—a vision for what I consider the perfect car. This site will document my journey as I turn that vision into reality: a full electric vehicle conversion of my favorite car, the 2013 Volvo V60, powered by the heart and soul of a Tesla.
                </p>

                <h2>The Foundation: The 2013 Volvo V60</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s just something about the V60 from this era. For me, it’s more than just a car; it feels like a beast. It has a weight and a solidity that gives you unshakeable confidence on the road. It’s a car that feels like it was forged to handle anything our Norwegian roads can throw at it—a machine that isn't afraid of a rough gravel track or a snowy mountain pass. It's practical, safe, and has a timeless design. This car is the perfect rugged, dependable shell for this build.
                </p>

                <h2>The Heart: A Tesla Drivetrain</h2>
                <p>
                    While I love the mechanical feel of a traditional car, I'm captivated by the future of automotive technology. Tesla represents that future. It’s about the intelligent features, the minimalist design, and most importantly, the revolutionary electric drivetrain. There is nothing that compares to the silent, instant, and overwhelming rush of torque from a Tesla motor. It’s a completely different driving experience—smooth, responsive, and incredibly powerful.
                </p>

                <h2>The Goal: A Car Without Compromise</h2>
                <p>
                    So, why go through all this effort? Because I want to create a vehicle that perfectly blends these two philosophies. This project is about taking the timeless, rugged body of the Volvo and infusing it with the futuristic, silent heart of a Tesla.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to build the ultimate daily driver and the perfect sleeper wagon. A car that retains the classic Scandinavian look and go-anywhere capability of the V60, but with the shocking acceleration and cutting-edge technology that only a world-class EV can provide. It's my vision of a car without compromise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Follow along as I tackle the design, fabrication, and electronic challenges of bringing this one-of-a-kind machine to life.
